## 2. Building the .tex File to Generate a PDF

To build the `.tex` file and generate a PDF document, follow these steps:

1. **Install LaTeX:** If you do not have LaTeX installed on your machine, download and install a LaTeX distribution from [here](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).
2. **Compile the .tex File:** Navigate to the directory containing the `.tex` file using a terminal. Once in the correct directory, run the following command:
```bash
pdflatex resume_template.tex
```
This will create a file called `resume_template.pdf` in the same directory.

Alternatively, you can use an online LaTeX editor like Overleaf to compile and download the PDF.
